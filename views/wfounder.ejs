        <p class="text">
          Pepcorn was born from the needs of people like us, crazy minds. Now,
          anyone â€” no matter how wealthy - can invest in the startups they
          love.Today, our country is facing serious issues and we need to
          address them now despite all odds. Entrepreneurship is dying; VCs look
          for big tags to fund, while deserving dies in uncertainty. Innovation
          has long been lost, and GDP growth has stagnated. There is an increase
          in wealth inequality. Our mission is to turn this trend around by
          offering funding to thousands of promising startups... and make us all
          a nation of owners, again. VCs, UHNIs, and bankers are not getting it
          done. It's not just about capital, but fair opportunities in the
          market for everyone. We are a nation of crazy minds, and if we are
          still not there then something is broken. Turning this game fair is
          our deal.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          Funding startups is risky, and you should never invest more than you
          can afford to lose. However, supporting more founders in starting
          companies and innovating is a good thing and a lifetime experience. |
          would encourage you to invite like minded peers to join India's
          growth.
        </p>
        <p class="text">
          I appereciate you pledging to support the next generation's big.
          Together we are going to bring change, the battle has just begun.
        </p>
        <p class="text">Happy investing!</p>
